This is my first Data Analytics project. Utilizing my Tableau skills, I crafted a dashboard replicating Emergency Room visits— a task typical of a Healthcare Data Analyst. The analysis of visits or customer traffic, a broadly applicable skill, plays a crucial role in enhancing client services across various analytics fields.

Here's an overview of my process:

Defining the Question:
- How can the hospital maximize efficiency in Emergency Department operations in order to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction?
- It is vital to understand areas of improvement and derive insights on wait times and satisfaction scores since we are dealing with an emergency room and people's lives are at stake.

Objective:
- I conducted an in-depth analysis of emergency room (ER) visit data, focusing on enhancing operational efficiency and elevating patient satisfaction through the creation of insightful visualizations.
- The key variables explored include the total number of ER patients (segmented by gender percentages), monthly trends in average wait time (depicted in a line graph), monthly variations in average patient satisfaction (illustrated with another line graph), distribution of patients by age in the emergency department (presented in an area chart), patient race (represented in a bar graph), average wait time visualized as a heat map, and departmental referrals showcased in a bar graph

Data Collection:
- I employed a RWFD (real-world fake data) dataset sourced from data.world, a valuable resource for healthcare analytics projects. Given the reluctance of hospitals to disclose sensitive information and the imperative to avoid HIPAA violations by safeguarding confidential patient data, acquiring clinical datasets for healthcare data analytics projects poses a challenge. Despite these obstacles, I successfully identified an ideal dataset, enabling me to replicate a genuine hospital environment in my analysis.

  Data Analysis:
  1. 𝘗𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘍𝘭𝘰𝘸: By monitoring monthly ER visits by gender and race, I identified peak periods, enabling resource allocation to effectively meet demand while better understanding our patient demographics.
  2. 𝘌𝘧𝘧𝘪𝘤𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘺: Analyzing average wait time revealed trends in busy days and times as well as bottlenecks, guiding process improvements to minimize patient wait times.
  3. 𝘗𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘦𝘯𝘵 𝘚𝘢𝘵𝘪𝘴𝘧𝘢𝘤𝘵𝘪𝘰𝘯: Correlating satisfaction scores with wait time and demographics highlighted insights on similarities and differences in patient happiness by age, race, gender, and time.
